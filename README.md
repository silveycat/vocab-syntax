This repository contains the following files:

1) `fake-lang-data.txt` - toy data that resembles the data analysed in the paper
2) `analysis_code.R` - script for running the main analyses reported in the paper and supplemental materials
3) `analysis_code_missing.R` - script for running the supplemental analysis reported in Text S2 (using only complete cases)
4) `strata_sim.R` - script for simulation to determine optimal number of strata for quantile binning analysis, reported in Text S4
5) `sample_sim.R` - script for simulation to determine whether quantile binning method returns robust results in small samples, reported in Text S5

Note that when run on the fake data, the analysis scripts will not perfectly reproduce the reported results.
